# SHPE UCF Mobile Apps
Mobile Applications (iOS & Android) for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers - UCF Chapter

## Install App for development/testing purposes

### Step 1 - Install
* Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
* Follow React Native environment set up here: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html (Come to meetings for help if needed)
* Clone this repository
* Once cloned go into project folder shpeucfapp/
* Run npm install

### Step 2 - Running the app
* If running the simulator on Android Studio, it needs to be opened before running the app, however, Xcode will launch the simulator for you.
* On the Terminal/Command Prompt make sure you are inside the project shpeucfapp/
* run: react-native run-ios (run-android for Android Studio)
* The app will launch a packager, building the app and opening it for you. If you get an error, close the terminal window that's named React Packager and run the command above again, it might fail because it is building the app for the first time and simulator does not synch with packager. 
* Now you should have the app

The steps above are a bit vague, but should get you going if you've been to meetings or have experience with Node.js or React. We will improve this docs soon.
